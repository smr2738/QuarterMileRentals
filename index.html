        <p>
            At Quarter Mile Rentals, we provide an easy to access way of transportation for  RIT students. The quarter mile is long, we all know that much. It feels longer than a quarter mile. We’ve envisioned a way to make that trek a little less grueling and a lot more fun! By encouraging the use of mechanical power, we promote students to be more active, and have fun doing so. We offer scooters, bikes, skateboards, roller skates, and roller blades for rent by the hour. For safety reasons, we also offer helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads. By providing these options, we seek to accommodate your schedule and transportation preferences.
	        <br><br>
            For those who don’t know how to, for example, roller skate, we offer volunteer and club-run lessons available to everyone. We want to encourage people to get out and be active in a way that’s engaging to them and to those around them. Make new friends, meet new people, foster growth and learning, and keep yourself active! Get involved in the community and get around campus with Quarter Mile Rentals!
